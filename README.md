# mod_stoolpigeon

This module compares the language strings between two installed languages and lists the missing strings to be added, additional strings to be deleted, and the untranslated language strings to be translated.
This is done ini file by file.
There is a provision to specify the language string constants that need not be translated (e.g., help).
